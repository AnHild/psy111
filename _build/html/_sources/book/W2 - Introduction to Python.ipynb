    "The Python programming language is a *general purpose* language, which means it is widely used in many fields, including statistics and neuroimaging. Python is a *high-level, interpreted* language, which means it offers a high level of abstraction and you do not need to worry about *low-level* things like memory management. Its syntax is also relatively simple and aims to be readable.\n",
