    "As previously mentioned, [everything in Python is an object](1_Everything_is_an_object). The key cocept behind this is the object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm central to many programming languages. I will try to briefly these concepts in this chapter, however, do not worry if you feel like these concepts do not immediately make sense to you. Learning a programming language is like learning a real language and takes time. I am however convinced that once the semester goes on many of these newly introduced concepts will already start to click as you work your way through the exercises.\n",

The first parameter is called `self`. It is a mandatory argument for any method whithin a class to take a reference to the current instance (*itself* so to say). The second argument `radius` then the first actual argument which has to be provided if a circle object is created.

There are many other methods like this, and the key concept already is that they are usually called implicitly when a certain operation is applied to an object, even though it does not look like the operation and the magic method hav anything to do with each other. That's what makes them magic!ðŸª„\n",

    "You are probably already tired of me saying \"everything in Python is an object\". However, you will now see one of the deeper implications this has. *All operators in Python are just cleverly disguised method calls*. That means even if we write something seemingly basic like `4 * 3`, Python will implicitly call a magic method on the first operant (the number 4 as an object of the integer class), with the second operand being passed as an argument. This might sound a bit confusing, but"
