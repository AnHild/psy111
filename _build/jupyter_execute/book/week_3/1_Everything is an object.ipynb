    "So far, and analogous to many other programming languages, you mught think of data types like strings or integers as *primitive* data types, which means that they are built into the core of the language to behave in special ways and to not be changed or modified in any way. And this is true in many\n",
    "other programming languages like C++. where you will have to explicitly tell the program what type of variable you want to create.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python this is a bit different and there aren't *really* any primitive datata types, as it is a deeply *object-oriented* programming language. In Python, *everything is an object*. Strings are objects, integers are objects, lists are objects, dictionairies are objects, and so fourth. We will come back to that concept in detail later today, but for now let us just focus on some practical implications this will bring.\n",

But don't worry, it essentially means that we simply call a function attached to the object (in this case the string). Such object specfic functions are called *methods*, so if you use `text.lower()` it will simply call the `.lower()` method of the string object. The dot operator expresses a relationship of belonging, so you can intuitively read `text.lower()` as \"on the text variable, use the .lower() method which belongs to it\".\n",
