# W5 - General Linear Model


In the previous statistics lecture you learnt about the General Linear Model (GLM). The approach for your first statistical model differs from testing your null hypothesis. Instead of just rejecting or accepting the null hypothesis after defining the aproppiate significance level and statistical test, itÂ´s more of an interactive analysis with GLMs. 
In todays Seminar we will have a look at the following content 

1. Multiple linear Regression
2. Correlation
3. Partial Correlation

After that you can try out your new skills on a dataset about diabetes and its risk factors.
