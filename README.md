**NOTE: WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Online usage (recommended)

Course materials for the psy111 seminar of the Neurocognitive Psychology Master's course at the University of Oldenburg. The content should primarily be accessed from the online book: [![Jupyter Book Badge](https://jupyterbook.org/badge.svg)](https://mibur1.github.io/psy111-book/)

## Local usage

Running the book locally is possible by opening the `_build/html/index.html` file in a browser. The *.ipynb* notebooks for the exercises can either be used locally or through google colab.

If the `_build/` folder is not available or if you want to create a modified version, you can also build the book from source:

```python
cd <path/to/book/>
pip install -r requirements.txt
jupyter-book build .
```
