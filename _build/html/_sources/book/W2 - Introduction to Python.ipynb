    "The Python programming language is a *general purpose* language, which means it is widely used in many fields, including statistics and neuroimaging. Python is a *high-level, interpreted* language, which means it offers a high level of abstraction and you do not need to worry about *low-level* things like memory management. The following introduction is losely based on the book \"Data Science for Neuroimaging: An Introduction\" by Ariel Rokem and Tal Yarkoni {cite}`Rokem2023`.\n",
