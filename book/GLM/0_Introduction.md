# W5 - General Linear Model (GLM)


In the previous statistics lecture, you were introduced to the General Linear Model (GLM). The approach for creating your first statistical model is different from simply testing a null hypothesis. Instead of just accepting or rejecting the null hypothesis based on a predefined significance level and statistical test, working with GLMs involves a more interactive analysis.

In today's seminar, we will cover the following topics:
1. Multiple Linear Regression
2. Correlation
3. Partial Correlation

After that, you will have the opportunity to apply your new skills to analyze a dataset related to diabetes and its risk factors.
