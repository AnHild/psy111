# W6 - <Categorical Regression>

In the previous seminar, you learned about GLMs, (partial) correlation, and how to implement them in Python. Today, we will add categorical variables, such as male/female or patients vs. controls. As you learned from the lecture, we will need a fitting coding scheme to answer our research question. We will focus on these four schemes from the lecture:

- Dummy coding
- Unweighted effects coding
- Weighted effects coding
- Contrast coding

After familiarizing yourself with these different kinds of schemes, you can try out your new set of skills on a dataset about heart disease.
