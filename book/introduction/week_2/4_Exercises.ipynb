Lets for example take the word *Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch*, which is a town in Wales. Can you find a function that lets you count the number of times the combination of two subsequent L's (e.g. \"ll\") appear in that word? See if you can guess how the function could be called and used. Use the internet for help if necessary.\n",

Experiment with this for a bit and then answer/implement the following questions:\n",
