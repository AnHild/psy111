# 1.2 Usage

At this point you should have previously installed Python (through miniconda) and Visual Studio Code.

**The Python interpeter**

In your programs, search for the `Anaconda (miniconda) prompt` and open it. If you type `python` and then press enter, the Python interpeter will start and show you the current Python version:

```
$ (base) >>>
```

The interpreter is ready to recieve commands and you can evaluate any kind of expression like adding two numbers:

```
$ (base) >>>
```

While this works for simple commands, it is not really useful for more complicated tasks. These would usually be implemented in self-contained Python scripts or jupyter notebooks.
